# SQL_AWESOME_CHOCOLATES-SALES-ANALYSIS-

Developed an extensive sales analysis project aimed at extracting actionable insights from customer sales databases. Leveraged SQL queries to perform data extraction, transformation, and analysis across multiple related tables, thereby enabling comprehensive reporting and decision-making processes
Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

Top Products Analysis (SQL Query 1):
•	Identified the top 10 best-performing products based on total sales volume.
•	Employed SQL JOIN operations and aggregate functions to aggregate sales data by product and compute total sales figures.


Geographical Customer Analysis (SQL Query 2):
•	Conducted a thorough examination of customer distribution across different geographical regions.
•	Utilized SQL JOINs and GROUP BY clauses to count the number of customers per region and rank regions by customer count.


Total Sales and Customer Analysis by Region (SQL Query 3):
•	Analyzed  total sales amounts and customer counts for each geographical region.
•	Employed SQL JOINs and aggregate functions to compute total sales and customer counts, providing valuable insights into regional performance.


•	Product Performance Analysis (SQL Queries 4 and 5):
•	Evaluated total sales and customer counts for each product and product category.
•	Leveraged SQL JOINs, aggregate functions, and GROUP BY clauses to aggregate sales data and identify high-performing products and categories.


Salesperson Performance Analysis (SQL Queries 6, 7, 8, and 9):
•	Investigated salesperson performance at both regional and overall levels.
•	Implemented advanced SQL techniques, including window functions and common table expressions (CTEs), to rank salespersons by total sales and identify top performers within regions and across geographies.

Monthly Sales Analysis (SQL Queries 10 and 11):
•	Examined total sales amounts and customer counts on a monthly basis to identify trends and peak periods.
•	Utilized SQL GROUP BY clauses and aggregate functions to aggregate sales data by month and year, highlighting the busiest months in terms of sales volume and customer activity.


Product Sales Trends Analysis (SQL Query 12):
•	Investigated sales trends over time for a specific product (e.g., 'P06').
•	Applied SQL filters and grouping to analyze sales data for the selected product across different time periods, providing insights into its performance trajectory.


•	Product Performance by Region (SQL Query 13 and 14):
Explored product performance across geographical regions and identified top-selling products in each region.
Utilized SQL window functions and subqueries to rank products by total sales within each region, facilitating targeted marketing and inventory management strategies.
